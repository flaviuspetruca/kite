## Technologies

    ReactJS
    LeafletJS

### Tasks

    Created Leaflet map with markers, based on the data provided by the api.
    Posibility to add/remove favourite spots(only if user is logged in).
    !!!I ADVISE SETTING FAVOURITE SPOTS AND LOGIN API DATA TO 0 BEFORE TESTING!!!.
    Filter markers shown on map feature.
    Table with spots data, created using MaterialUI, that can be sorted.
    (Didn't include a searchbar beacuse the table already has a filter option for all columns)
    Also table has pagination included.
    Responsive design.
    Requests are handled properly and show different data depending on the status.
